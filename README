ncclient OpenDaylight Integration
============================================================================

This project is aimed towards providing ncclient integration with OpenDaylight.
ncclient is a netconf client tool written in python.

OpenDaylight has a NETCONF project, called netconf.  NETCONF is dependent
upon parsing from yangtools, which has an extremely narrow and strict
interpretation of the YANG modeling language.  This is not necessarily a bad
thing, since variations in protocol implementation can have non-desirable
side effects.  However, this could prevent integration with a southbound
device which provides a non-parsable YANG model.  Additionally, netconf
has a very strict intepretation of the NETCONF protocol which often leads
to inability to interoperate with southbound devices.

ncclient integration is an attempt to provide an alternative netconf
implementation based on existing software.
